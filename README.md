# 🍽️ OneBytes — Full-Stack Food Delivery Web Application

**OneBytes** is a full-stack food delivery web application designed to simulate a real-world ordering experience from browsing restaurants to placing an order. It was built with a focus on clean architecture, user-friendly interfaces, and modular backend design. This project showcases an end-to-end system using **Java**, **JSP/Servlets**, **JDBC**, and **MySQL**, complemented with a responsive frontend using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**.

## 📌 Features

- 🏪 **Browse Restaurants & Menus**  
  Users can explore multiple restaurants and their available food items in a structured and clean UI.

- 🛒 **Cart Functionality**  
  Dynamic cart system using session management to add, remove, and update food items.

- 📦 **Order Placement**  
  Users can enter a delivery address, choose a payment method (visual), and place an order, which is saved in the database across multiple tables (`orders`, `order_items`, and `order_history`).

- 🧩 **MVC Design Pattern**  
  The backend follows the **Model-View-Controller (MVC)** architecture with **DAO (Data Access Object)** for a clean separation of concerns.
